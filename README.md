This is my personal website built to showcase some of my work using the new [POQD stack](https://kabeech.com/poqd)

Please be aware that this website is very much a work in progress. Much of it is expected to be broken or not yet built out. But feel free to poke around if you like!

# To-Do

## Add Features

### Small Features

* Make background scroll

### Big Features

* Al Lugha Misma
* Store
* Users

### Add Content

* Pronoun page
* Beechy page
* POQD page

### Integrate Into Main Site (using APIs)

* Buddh-A-Sketch
* Tic-Tac-Toebot

## Fix

* Make Hamburger icons overflow
* Stabilize screen height
* Make response confirm/cancel buttons images (instead of text)
* Add padding to screen content
* Consider reorganizing columns in POQD page for mobile
* Improve the gradient transitions into the ScreenContents: make the inner color transparent and make it overlap with the ScreenContents (so that it fades gradually into the text/images on screen instead of making a sharp line)

## Cleanup

### Clean up CSS

#### Seriously

* Clean up all the CSS

#### Also

* Remove box-shadow from text
* Add box-shadow to images and buttons in ScreenContents
* Maybe make the (webkit) scrollbar a lil wider?
* Reassess font size (for mobile)?
