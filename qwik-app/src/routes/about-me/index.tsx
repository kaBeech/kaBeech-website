        <p>
          My name's Kyle Beechly and I'm a software engineer from the Pacific
          Northwest (in America). I built this site to showcase some of my work
          using the new{" "}
          <Link class="link" href="/poqd">
            POQD stack
          </Link>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can{" "}
          <Link class="link" href="https://github.com/kaBeech">
            find more of my work on GitHub!
          </Link>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested, I prefer{" "}
          <Link class="link" href="pronouns">
            xe/xyr or ze/zyr pronouns
          </Link>
          . I'm not very strict about it though, as long as you're being
          compassionate â™¡
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding you can probably find me running, building fantasy
          worlds for tabletop roleplaying games, or SHREDDING guitar
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have an{" "}
          <Link class="link" href="beechy">
            avatar named Beechy
          </Link>
          , who is the one saying these words to you!
