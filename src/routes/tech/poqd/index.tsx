        <p>
          This website is built using next-generation JavaScript software in a

        </p>
        <p>
          I first learned professional web development using a software stack
          known as MERN, which stands for 'MongoDB, Express, React, and
          Node.js'. The POQD stack is a similar concept using newer technology
          and stands for 'PostgreSQL, Oak, Qwik, and Deno'

        <p>
          The more I grow, the less dogmatic I get about database choices. These
          days non-relational databases like MongoDB (using NoSQL) can do most
          of what relational databases like Postgres (using SQL) do and vice
          versa. Because of this, the remainder of this section is more flowery
          and less science-based than the others - feel free to skip ahead.
          You've been warned
        </p>
        <p>
          MongoDB's great. It's easy to use, has friendly documentation, and
          notably offers a very accessible multi-cloud developer data platform
          in MongoDB Atlas
        </p>
        <p>
          But I just like Postgres. It feels good on my brain. The color scheme
          is nice. The community is great. The elephant is a kind and noble
          creature
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL just makes sense to me. I understand I'm in the minority here, but
          I'm more likely to feel frustrated than relieved when working in a
          system that tries to map program execution onto natural language. Not
          that MongoDB does that per se, but the firm and simple logic of SQL
          feels good to me
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL is fast and it provides easy methods to combine data. The
          advantages of NoSQL are that it's easily expansible and you don't have
          to plan ahead as much
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, these days both SQL and NoSQL have evolved to the point that
          they're both viable options for many projects. It just depends on how
          you prefer to think about your data. It sounds like an old k≈çan by
          now: do you want a document full of tables (MongoDB) or a table full
          of documents (Postgres)?
        </p>
        <p>
          I like speed by default and I'm the kind of person who both a) likes
          to plan ahead before actually building a project and b) doesn't mind
          rewriting things if I really need to. PostgreSQL for me, please

        <h3 class="responseTextLight">Why Oak?</h3>
        <p>
          Oak does exactly what I want, when I want, and nothing else. It is a
          middleware framework, which means I can patch together functions to
          enhance the functionality of the runtime (in this case Deno) when I
          want to, and leave out unnecessary code when I don't
        </p>
        <p>
          This developer experience feels natural to me. It reminds me of
          chaining together guitar effects on a pedal board
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the same is true for Express, but Oak is designed to be used with
          Deno! There are some nice things about the way Oak works (many
          inherited from its spritual predecessor in Node.js,{" "}
          <Link class="link" href="https://koajs.com/">
            Koa
          </Link>
          ), but at the end of the day, I mostly use Oak because it's the most
          widely-used and supported analog to Express in Deno Land

              <li>
                5. The client then parses all the JavaScript. That means the
                client looks at the JavaScript and has to figure out what the
                heck is going on. This can be a lot of JavaScript to understand,

          For example, Deno assumes that it doesn't have permission to do pretty
          much anything without asking. Consent is sexy, including in data
          privacy and security. Deno supports ES Modules by default rather than
          CommonJS, which encourages future-facing development. Deno caches
          needed dependencies on your file system, doing away with{" "}

          Deno is created by the same person who created the industry standard

          When I start building a project, I don't want to spend time setting up

        <h1 id="why-poqd">Summary</h1>
        <h3 class="responseTextLight">
          Okay, but give it to me in a nutshell. Why do you use POQD?
        </h3>
        <h2>1. It's Accessible for Developers</h2>
        <p>
          I value tools that enable me to start working right away. The less
          time I have to use at the start of a new project to configure my setup
          and learn new methods of doing things, the better. Getting to focus on
          the meat of my project quickly pays dividends
        </p>
        <p>
          POQD has a low configuation overhead. Instead of having to set up a
          TypeScript compiler, a linter, a package manager, a bundler, and so
          forth, it's already built in!
        </p>
        <p>
          POQD is easy to learn! The next-generation software it uses was
          designed to be familiar to those using software in the MERN stack. If
          you're comfortable with MERN, you're most of the way there already!
        </p>
        <h2>2. It's Performant</h2>
        <p>
          Sites built with POQD can be fast. Like really really fast. BLAZINGLY
          FAST, some might say
        </p>
        <p>
          Go ahead and click around this site. See how much time you spend
          waiting for a page to load. Run a Lighthouse test (Performance usually
          comes back with a perfect 100 for me). There may not be much here yet,
          but I have more content planned that will demonstrate further how
          quick and responsive it is. To get a taste for now, try{" "}
          <Link class="link" href="/fun/flower?pride=true">
            playing around with this flower
          </Link>
        </p>
        <h2>3. It's Smart</h2>
        <p>
          The software in POQD is built in a way that encourages good coding
          practices. I'll give a couple examples:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 1:</strong> Deno only supports URLs for loading
          dependencies (as opposed to Node.js, which supports both URLs and
          modules). Why would I want to use a tool that does less things? Well,
          (perhaps obviously), browsers also only support URLs. Using a runtime
          that loads dependencies in the same way a browser does forces me to
          write code that is more easily consumable by browsers
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe the code I'm writing isn't expected to run on a browser. But we
          all know that plans evolve, and writing code this way allows me to be
          more modular in case a browser may want to consume my code someday
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 2:</strong> Deno restricts file system and network
          access by default. That means if I use Deno to run a program that
          sends information over my network (without explicitly saying it can do
          that), Deno will ask first before sending any info. This may be a
          small annoyance if you forget to allow permission - and 'deno run
          --allow-read --allow-net app' may be more keystrokes than 'npm run
          app' - but the peace of mind knowing I won't accidentally send data
          where I don't mean to is worth it to me

          <strong>Example 3:</strong>{" "}
          <Link class="link" href="/fun/flower?pride=true">
            Qwik uses symbolic slots
          </Link>
          . Qwik renders parents and children in perfect isolation. This means
          it can render the parent component without rerendering the children
          and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, because slots are symbolic, the children can NOT be read or
          transformed by the components, like is possible in React. This means
          if you're a lazy kaBeech just hacking together a website real fast,
          you might hit a point where your mind is screaming "Why can't I just
          pass this state in to every possible child of this slot component the
          way I can with React????"
        </p>
        <p>
          But after a minute (you are a very smart and attractive kaBeech after
          all), you'll start to ask yourself "Okay, but why do I need to pass
          state to components that I haven't even built yet?" And then you'll
          realize that you could structure the whole thing in a more organized,
          more performant way
